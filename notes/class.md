# Class


### Methods
When invoked inside the class, the `this` keyword is `NOT` necessary.

### Method overloading
Consists on using the same method name but with different paramenters. It does NOT work just by reusing the same signature and parameters and changing the return type, it needs to change the number of parameters.
