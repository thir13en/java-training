# The History of Java


Java is a general-purpose programming language that is **class-based**, **object-oriented**. It is intended to let application developers **write once, run anywhere (WORA)**. Java applications are typically compiled to **bytecode** that can run on any **Java virtual machine (JVM)** regardless of the underlying computer architecture.  
Java was originally developed by [James Gosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling) at **Sun Microsystems** (which has since been acquired by **Oracle**) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
