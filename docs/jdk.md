# JDK

The `Java Development Kit` is the **toolkit** used to develop `Java Applications`. There was a major change in the language in Java 8, and it has evolved until reaching version 14 at the moment of writing this.  

There are plenty of different `vendors` that produce their own version of the `JDK`, for example `Oracle`, `Amazon`, `IBM`, `Azul Systems`, `OpenJDK` and `Red Hat`. Even thoy there are so many vendors, they still stick to the same release number and lifecycle.  

It is a very common thing for companies with large codebases to stick to JDK version 11, given the fact that no breaking changes where done up until this version.


### Adopt OpenJDK
Website that provides a very easy way to install OpenJDK on your computer.

### Oracle
They produce a Commercial and an Open Source version. The Commercial version is released under the `Oracle Technology Network` license or `OTN`, which means is free for personal or learning purposes, but you need to pay if you are a professional company. Oracle also release a `OpenJDK` open sourced version, under the GNU + Classpath exception license, which basically means that you DO NOT need to release your source code if you build something based on the `OpenJDK`.

### Amazon
They have a free OpenJDK version named `Amazon Corretto`. They have only two version, the 8th and the 11th. They are also contributing to maintaining the OpenJDK.  

### Red Hat
Based on the OpenJDK.

### Azul Systems
Based on the OpenJDK, less Ecosystem, focused on raising the performance of the JVM.
